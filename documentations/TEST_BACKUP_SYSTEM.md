## Automated Test Script

Create this file for quick testing: `tests/Feature/DatabaseBackupTest.php`

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use Tests\TestCase;
use App\Models\User;
use App\UserRole;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

class DatabaseBackupTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;

    public function test_admin_can_access_backup_page()
    {
        $admin = User::factory()->create(['role' => UserRole::ADMIN]);
        
        $response = $this->actingAs($admin)->get('/database-backup');
        
        $response->assertStatus(200);
    }

    public function test_non_admin_cannot_access_backup_page()
    {
        $user = User::factory()->create(['role' => UserRole::STAFF]);
        
        $response = $this->actingAs($user)->get('/database-backup');
        
        $response->assertStatus(403);
    }

    public function test_admin_can_create_backup()
    {
        $admin = User::factory()->create(['role' => UserRole::ADMIN]);
        
        $response = $this->actingAs($admin)->post('/database-backup/create');
        
        $response->assertRedirect('/database-backup');
        $response->assertSessionHas('success');
    }
}
```

Run tests:
```bash
php artisan test --filter DatabaseBackupTest
```
